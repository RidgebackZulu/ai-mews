title: "Chrome extensions caught hijacking affiliate links and stealing ChatGPT tokens"
dek: "Browser add-ons that 'do the thing'… and also quietly do a second thing for someone else."
sourceUrl: "https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/researchers-uncover-chrome-extensions.html"
bullets:
  - "Researchers report a cluster of browser extensions that inject affiliate tags into shopping links."
  - "Some extensions also collect sensitive data, including OpenAI ChatGPT authentication tokens."
  - "The behavior is hidden behind legitimate advertised functionality (e.g., ad blocking)."
  - "Takeaway: treat extensions like software vendors; least-install wins."
take: "Extensions are the new freeware toolbars: shiny, convenient, and occasionally a parasitic lifeform. If your org allows arbitrary extensions, you don’t have a browser policy — you have vibes."
